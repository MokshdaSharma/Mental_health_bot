# Problem Statement

**Early Identification of Mental Health Disorders in Students Using Advanced Ensemble Machine Learning Techniques for Proactive Intervention.**

Mental health disorders—especially **stress, anxiety, and depression**—are increasingly prevalent among students, with studies showing that **over one-third suffer from moderate to severe symptoms**, and a significant number experience **suicidal thoughts**.  

Despite the high prevalence, **more than 60% of students do not seek support**, often due to stigma, lack of awareness, or limited access to mental health services. Left undetected, these issues can escalate, severely impacting **academic performance**, **social life**, and **long-term well-being**.

Current detection methods largely rely on self-reported questionnaires like the **PHQ-9** and **GAD-7**, which, while useful, are often **reactive** and dependent on a student's willingness to disclose symptoms.  

There is an urgent need for a **proactive, data-driven system** that can identify students at risk of mental health disorders **before these issues become critical**, thereby enabling timely intervention and support.

## Project Objectives

- Predict whether a student is at risk of a mental health disorder.
- Estimate levels of **stress**, **anxiety**, and **depression** on a scale of **1 to 5**.
- Build a **robust**, **scalable**, and **accurate model** using **ensemble learning techniques**.
- Take user inputs on **lifestyle**, **academic**, and **social factors** for **live predictions**.
